echo "Testing the merged form responses functionality\n";
echo "==============================================\n\n";

echo "Before the changes:\n";
echo "- Alumni responses were shown as separate entries\n";
echo "- One entry for 'Form Response' from form_responses table\n";
echo "- Another entry for 'Employment Data' from employment_records table\n";
echo "- This caused confusion when viewing responses\n\n";

echo "After the changes:\n";
echo "- Alumni responses are now merged into single entries\n";
echo "- Each alumni appears only once in the response list\n";
echo "- Combined data from both form_responses and employment_records tables\n";
echo "- Clear indicators show what type of data is available:\n";
echo "  * 'Complete Response' - Both form and employment data\n";
echo "  * 'Form Only' - Only form response data\n";
echo "  * 'Employment Only' - Only employment record data\n\n";

echo "Backend Changes Made:\n";
echo "1. Modified form_responses.php to merge responses by alumni_id\n";
echo "2. Updated count logic to count unique alumni instead of separate responses\n";
echo "3. Added flags (has_form_data, has_employment_data) to track data types\n\n";

echo "Frontend Changes Made:\n";
echo "1. Updated badge display to show data type indicators\n";
echo "2. Added visual cues for data completeness\n";
echo "3. Improved response data section with better labeling\n\n";

echo "Benefits:\n";
echo "- Eliminates confusion from duplicate alumni entries\n";
echo "- Provides clearer view of response completeness\n";
echo "- Maintains all original data while improving presentation\n";
echo "- More accurate response counts\n";
